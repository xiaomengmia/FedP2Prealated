## P2P Federated Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains projects related to P2PFL by our research group. The projects are as follows

* FML: A library of utilities and implementation for Gossip based P2P federated machine learning.

* CIFAR10Res-AsycGossip-3Groups-FractionC-ensemble-100clients-randomdrop: A project that implements federated learning on the CIFAR10 dataset using the asynchronous gossip algorithm. The setup consists of 3 groups with a fraction of clients contributing to the global model. An ensemble model is constructed based on the models from 100 clients, with random drop in communication.

* FilecoinManager: A GUI that manages Filecoin, a decentralized storage system. It is proposed to be used in conjunction with the other projects to manage the storage of data and models in a decentralized manner.

## Running the Projects

Each project can be run independently. Refer to the README.md files within each folder for specific instructions on how to run the projects.
